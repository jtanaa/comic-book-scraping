# comic-book-scraping
This python file will transfer any comicbook on comic.kukudm.com into one single webpage

All you have to do is install requirement library first like this(notice the \,/ difference in windows cmd and linux,OS Terminal):
pip install -r \path\to\requirements.txt

And then
python /path/to/parse_kukudm.py

Then a input will prompt asking you to provide the first page url of the comicbook.
After the input, the program will run for 2-3 minutes and the 'clarified' html page will prompt automatically. (Actually the html page is stored locally at path/to/parse_kukudm.py/pics/pics.html
